# exts2c
TypeScript transpiler/compiler to C++ language

The goal is to transpile TypeScript dialect to C++23 source code with the
possibility of disabling all memory allocations and usage of C++ STD and STL.

By default, code generated by this transpiler should be compiled in compiler
with C++23 support and flags `-fno-rtti` and `-fno-exceptions`. More may to come
as the project progresses.
